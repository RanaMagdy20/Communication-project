# Communication-project
A MATLAB code that takes an arbitrary number of signals as an input (M signals)
and uses Gram-Schmidt procedure to produce the minimum number of required orthonormal
basis functions (N bases function) to represent the M signals. Use constellation diagram to
calculate the probability of errors in the system practically.
